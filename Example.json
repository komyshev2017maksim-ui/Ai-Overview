      "text": "Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it acts as an orchestration system, organizing containerized workloads across clusters of physical or virtual machines, enabling high availability, portability, and efficient resource utilization.\n\nKey aspects of Kubernetes include:\n\n- Container Orchestration: It automates the lifecycle of containerized applications, such as those created with Docker.\n- Automated Scaling: It can scale applications up or down based on traffic or resource usage.\n- High Availability: It ensures applications are always running, with features like self-healing (restarting failed containers) and automated rollouts/rollbacks.\n- Platform Agnostic: It runs on-premises, in public clouds, or in hybrid environments.\n- Key Components: A cluster consists of a \"control plane\" (manages the cluster) and \"nodes\" (run the applications).\n\nBy using Kubernetes, developers can abstract away the underlying infrastructure, focusing on deploying their code without needing to manage the servers it runs on."
